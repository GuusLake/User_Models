# Visual Distractions & Adaptive Automation

## Introduction and motivation
In this project a user model will be implemented that focusses on visual distractions during driving. 
The user model aims to benefit driver safety by adaptively changing the levels of automation with a change of distraction.
For this project visual objects will be placed on a driving simulation, by using eye-tracking we will be able to find which items are most distracting / give the control to an automated driving system.
