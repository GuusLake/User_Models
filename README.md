## Implementation

## Experiment setup
Our experiment will measure if drivers are distracted and let the ACT-R model take over as is described in the Implementation section. We will create two types of distractions: 

- A simple and boring distraction 
- A more striking and exciting distraction

We plan to do this by creating "bill boards" of a boring colour like gray and a more visually distracting like cyan.

Thus we let a participant drive for four sessions:

- A practise session
- A session with small disctractions
- A session with large distractions
- A session with mixed distractions

Afterwards we can measure how often the system had to take over to determine how distracted our drivers.
